# Contributing to VueCast

Thanks for taking the time to contribute! This guide covers how to set up the repo, make changes, and submit a PR.

## Quick Start

```bash
# clone

git clone https://github.com/techakayy/vuecast.git
cd vuecast

# install (pnpm is required)
pnpm install

# build all packages
pnpm build
```

## Requirements

- Node.js (recent LTS recommended)
- pnpm `8.15.4` (see `package.json` → `packageManager`)

If you use a different pnpm version, you may see lockfile drift.

## Repo Layout

```
vuecast/
├── packages/
│   └── astro-module/     # @vuecast/astro-module integration
├── playground/           # local demo apps
│   └── astro-tailwind/
├── dist/                 # build artifacts (workspace root)
└── package.json
```

## Development

Run all package dev tasks (if any):

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Run a playground app:

```bash
pnpm play-tailwind
```

## Testing

Run tests across packages:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Note: Not every package currently defines a `test` script. If a package has its own tests, you can run them from that package directory.

## Working on `@vuecast/astro-module`

Common workflow:

```bash
cd packages/astro-module
pnpm build
```

If you change build output or types, make sure the `dist/` output is regenerated by running the build at the package or workspace root.

## Code Style & Quality

- Keep changes focused and easy to review.
- Prefer small, well-scoped commits.
- Update docs when behavior or usage changes.

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
